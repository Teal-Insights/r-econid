## Overview

The `econid` R package is a foundational building block of the [econdataverse](https://econdataverse.org) family of packages aimed at helping economists and financial professionals work with sovereign-level economic data. The package is aimed at domain experts in economics and finance who need to analyze and join data across multiple sources, but who aren't necessarily R programming experts.

## Motivation

Economic and financial datasets present unique challenges when working with country-level data:

1. **Mixed Entity Types**

Datasets often combine different types of entities in the same "country" column:

   - Countries and sovereign states
   - Territories and administrative regions (e.g., Puerto Rico, Hong Kong)
   - Geographic or economic aggregates (e.g., "Sub-Saharan Africa", "Low Income Countries")
   - International institutions (e.g., "World Bank", "IMF")

2. **Inconsistent Naming**

The same entity might appear in various formats:

   - Different codes (ISO-2, ISO-3, numeric codes)
   - Various name formats (e.g., "United States", "US", "U.S.A.")
   - Historical names or non-English variants

3. **Complex Analysis Needs**

Researchers often need to:

   - Compare individual countries with regional aggregates (e.g., Nigeria vs. Sub-Saharan Africa)
   - Join data across datasets with different naming conventions
   - Handle ambiguous cases (e.g., "Congo" could refer to multiple countries)
   - Work with specialized entities not in standard ISO lists

`econid` addresses these challenges through:

- Robust name standardization with clear entity type identification
- Flexible customization options for special cases
- Warning systems for missing or ambiguous matches
- Tools for fuzzy searching, filtering, and joining across datasets

## Design Philosophy

The design philosophy of the package follows [tidyverse principles](https://www.tidyverse.org/principles/) and the [tidy tools manifesto](https://www.tidyverse.org/manifesto/). We strive to practice human-centered design, with clear documentation and examples and graceful handling of edge cases. We invite you to submit suggestions for improvements and extensions on the package's [Github Issues](https://github.com/Teal-Insights/r-econid/issues) page.

We have designed the package to handle only the most common entities financial and economic professionals might encounter in a dataset (249 in total), not to handle every edge case. However, the package allows users to extend the standardization list with custom entities to flexibly accommodate any unconventional use case.

## Installation

Until the package is published on CRAN, you can install it from GitHub using the `remotes` package.

```r
remotes::install_github("Teal-Insights/r-econid")
```

Then, load the package in your R session or Quarto or RMarkdown notebook:

```r
library(econid)
```

## Usage

### The `standardize_economy()` function

The core function in the package is `standardize_economy()`, which takes the following arguments:

- A tibble containing unstandardized country names
- The name of the column containing these names
- An optional column containing codes (particularly useful for aggregates)
- Optional `custom_data` for adding new entities
- Optional `name_aliases` for common variants

The function returns:

- `economy_name`: standardized name
- `economy_id`: iso3c code for countries, custom ID for aggregates
- `economy_type`: distinguishes between "Country/Economy" and "Aggregate"

### Extending the standardization list with custom entities

The `standardize_economy()` function allows users to extend the standardization list with custom entities. This is particularly useful for:

- Small territories not in standard ISO lists
- Newly independent states
- Special administrative regions
- Custom aggregate entities specific to a project

Here is an example of how to extend the standardization list with a custom entity:

```r
custom_data <- tibble::tibble(
  country.name.en = "Kosovo",
  country.name.en.regex = "kosovo",
  iso3c = "XKX",
  iso2c = "XK"
)

standardize_economy(
  data = data,
  col = "country.name.en",
  custom_data = custom_data
)
```

### Adding name aliases

The `standardize_economy()` function allows users to add name aliases for common variants of entity names. This is useful for:

- Common abbreviations or alternate names
- Historical names
- Non-English names that appear in datasets

The `name_aliases` argument should be a named vector directly mapping non-standard names to standard ones. Here is an example of how to add name aliases:

```r
name_aliases <- c(
  "the states" = "United States",
  "republic of korea" = "South Korea",
  "holland" = "Netherlands"
)

standardize_economy(
  data = data,
  col = "country.name.en",
  name_aliases = name_aliases
)
```

## Roadmap

- Users should be able to extend the list
- Users should be able to add the standardized columns to any table
- Maybe a fuzzy join function
- And a fuzzy filter function
